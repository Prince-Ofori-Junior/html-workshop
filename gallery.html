    <h1> My Life Journey As A Web Developer.</h1>

<section >
    <p> At first i  thought it was an easy task to develop a website until i started practicing it myself day and night to overcome my fears in developing a standard projects.
         I started watching you-tube videos from a content creator called Bro code,
        because freecodecamp was new to me and do not understand anything on the site. So i overcome every fear and started freecodecamp with ease practice.
        After everything i started building a some standard website and also able to apply css to my website.
    </p>
    <p> Web hosting started when my lecturer thought us about it and told us to work on it. So through the guidance and commitment I was able to host my website at ease on a free web host called tinny.
        But what has motivated me most was freecodecamp certification projects thats is acquire at every end of a session. 
        And with persistent hard work i am able to acquire a certificate from freecodecamp.
